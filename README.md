# Multi-levelRegistration

The Multi-Level Registration algorithm developed by Emily Hammond. This repository includes two versions: 
(Slicer) interfaces with 3D Slicer to create a GUI that can be used
(cmd) interfaces with the command line for easy batch scripting without needed to build 3D Slicer from source.
